      => Generally after running "terraform apply" command, the new "terraform.tfstate" will create.

      => Terraform will use this "terraform.tfstate" file to build or make any changes to the infrastructure, to apply the configuration which we define in the                   configuration      file.

      => This "terraform.tfstate" contains resource metadata and terraform managed resource details, so storing this terraform state file on local machine is not a good           practice. 

      => So storing terraform state file on remote location is the best practice.
